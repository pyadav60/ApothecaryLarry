# Apothecary Larry
...is a multi-genre GBA adventure developed over about a month at Georgia Tech during Spring 2023 for a final class project!

It's a pretty simple journey with a little buddy Larry, who is on a quest to brew a potion! You will travel to the four corners of the world to gather ingredients. More buddies like Sherry, Gary, Teri will aid you along the way.  For the mandatory cheat feature, you can summon the Apothecary Fairy, who will aid you with often... questionable substances from the apothecary. 

## Controls
- START - Navigation + Pause
- SELECT - Navigation
- DPAD - Movement
- A - Interact
- B - Cheat! (Apothecary Fairy)

Note all actual key binds can be adjusted from mGBA emulator.

## Dev Comments
The game is simple enough to complete without dialogue, but that's probably the biggest shortcoming of this project. Sprite-backed dialogue in GBA Mode 5 is real tough to work with. If you're wondering why the whole concept is so barebones, the entire class is essentially focused on learning each GBA Mode and building from the ground up.

## Install instructions
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this game. I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class. I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM. If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can! Larry has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!

You can see some previews on itch.io: https://pyadav60.itch.io/apothecary-larry

We utilized Docker in tandem with mGBA to run class assignments, not sure about the logistics of running it without Docker, but afaik, the ROM should be enough.
